        <td><p style="width: 700px; height: 200px">Cristiano Ronaldo, known more for his explosive power, precision, and efficiency than flair, has rarely used the rainbow kick in competitive matches. Unlike players such as Neymar or Ronaldinho, who often incorporate freestyle moves into their style, Ronaldo’s gameplay is built around directness, speed, and goal-scoring. However, during his early career at Manchester United and in training sessions, he occasionally showcased the rainbow kick, demonstrating his technical ability and versatility. These moments reflected his all-rounded skill set—proving that while he may not rely on flashy tricks during high-stakes games, he certainly possesses the control and creativity to execute them when needed.</p></td>
